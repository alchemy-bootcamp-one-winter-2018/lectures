1. Test your presentation:
    * As your teams now have MVP in place and are focusing more on layout, design, and stretch goals today, take a few minutes at some point to take a look at your app on the projector/screen setup. You'll be glad you did. It's often a moment of, "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!" Note that the Career Track has lecture in the afternoon, so try to get this done before 1pm.
    
2. Plan your presentation:
   1. Please introduce yourself at the beginning of your presentation. A simple "Hi, I'm X" will do. Not everyone in the audience will know your name.
   1. Structure your presentation into two sections. Each team member needs to contribute and talk during each section. You all put a lot of hard into your project and now's the time to talk about what you did and what you learned.
      1. Demo your app (around 7-10 minutes)
         * Explain your app idea or concept. If your app solves a problem, explain that, too!
         * Show us what your app can do, don't just tell us!
         * Don't tell us what your app can't do.
      1. Talk about the tech (10-15 minutes)
         * Each person on the team will talk about some code they wrote.
         * You can talk about a problem or challenge you figured out, something new you learned, or something that finally started to click during project week.
         * Do not wing this. Have something in mind before presenting and know what you want to say.
         * Showing code is not mandatory, but if you do, don't walk us line by line.
   1. Ask for questions after everyone has finished sharing.

3. Rehearse your presentation:
    * Decide who's machine will present the app on the projector, test it, and then test a second computerâ€¦ just in case.
