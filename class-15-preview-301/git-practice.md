## Merge Conflict Exercise

Merge conflicts occur when files get out of sync between GitHub and a user's local codebase, and Git becomes unsure of where `HEAD` really is.

Let's describe how a pretend team would get into that situation and then extricate themselves from it.

Assign a member of your team to each character, and then do what they do. And do ONLY what they do.

Our sample team has four members: Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice. 

1. Add a file called `README.md` to the `master` branch of a repo called 'mc-exercise' you create for this lab. When we start, everyone is totally in sync and freshly pulled from `master` on their individual laptops, and has `README.md`.

1. Bob and Carol are pair-programming one feature in `README.md` on Carol's laptop in a new feature branch, and Ted and Alice are working on another feature in a different non-master feature branch on Ted's laptop, also in `README.md`.

1. For the purposes of this exercise, the work you're doing on a feature, always in `README.md`, consists of adding a sentence or two of "This is what Bob & Carol did on Bob's computer when working on the first feature" and maybe a joke or something to keep your teammates amused.

1. Bob and Carol get their feature finished and do a A-C-P of their branch from Carol's laptop and make a PR. Ted & Alice review the feature, deem that it is good and subsequently merge it. Ted & Alice then do a `git pull origin master` into their feature branch on Ted's laptop ONLY and continue working on that feature.

1. In the meantime, Bob & Carol have switched to Bob's laptop, started a new feature branch in `README.md`, and started working on it. They did not do a `git pull origin master` and will live to regret it. They finish that feature at the same time that Ted & Alice finish their feature. Each team does an A-C-P and makes a PR. They review each other's PRs and attempt to merge them.

1. Chaos ensues. Try to get it sorted out. Get everyone's individual laptop back in sync by doing a `git pull origin master` into `master` until Git stops complaining

1. Then they switch partners, of course. Bob & Alice start a quick new feature on her laptop in the `master` branch and Ted & Carol start another new feature of their own, also in `master`. They finish these quick features, and attempt to A-C-P and create/merge PRs.

**MERGE CONFLICTS** erupt like a horde of screaming sugar-filled children in a Chuck-E-Cheese.

It's time to get them sorted out.

How could these problems have been prevented?

Review the workflow on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and try to identify all of the individual things that they did wrong **AND** all of the things that they should have done but failed to do.
